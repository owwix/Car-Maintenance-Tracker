# Car-Maintenance-Tracker
This is a car maintenance tracker that I am working on as a personal project.
It is designed to be a basic CRUD application that helps track maintenance history for a vehicle.
JavaFX and FXML are used for the graphical user interface. 
SceneBuilder is used to generate XML for interface.
Java and Sqlite3 are used for backend/database processes.
A work in progress.
